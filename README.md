# Social-Box
This project is one which was done by a group of six of us for our second year group project. I handled most of the front end of the application, along with some help from others for linking it up to the back-end of the project.

## The Project
Social-Box is a mobile application which resembles the use of the black box in cars, which is used to monitor the users
driving and lower their insurance. We have taken this idea of monitoring the users driving and turned into a social app.
The app will monitor the users driving and then give them a score using a star rating. The score will be calculated
using the user's speed, acceleration and time of day. Once your journey has finished the app will show you the route
you took and which areas you drove worse in. The social aspect of the app comes in with the addition of friends, here
you will be able to see your friends star rating and be able to compare with your star rating and others. This creates
some healthy competition between friends to see who is the safest driver.

The target audience is anyone who is able to drive. We imagine it will be younger drivers who will use it the most as
they are least experienced and will want to know where they can improve on their driving. Moreover, the parents of
these drivers could also access their child's information through their account on the app to keep an eye on how well
their child drives.

Most users will use this app to compare their score with other friends to see how well they drive compared to others.
However, it could also be used to see how well you drive and see which areas of your daily commute you drive worse
in and therefore improve in those areas whether it be that you speed too much or brake too hard. This app could also
be used by parents or other guardians to see how well their child drives to make sure they are driving safely.

## Usage
