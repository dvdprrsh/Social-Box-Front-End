# Social-Box
This project is one which was done by a group of six of us for our second year group project. I handled most of the front end of the application, along with some help from others for linking it up to the back-end of the project.

## The Project
Social-Box is a mobile application which resembles the use of the black box in cars, which is used to monitor the users
driving and lower their insurance. We have taken this idea of monitoring the users driving and turned into a social app.
The app will monitor the users driving and then give them a score using a star rating. The score will be calculated
using the user's speed, acceleration and time of day. Once your journey has finished the app will show you the route
you took and which areas you drove worse in. The social aspect of the app comes in with the addition of friends, here
you will be able to see your friends star rating and be able to compare with your star rating and others. This creates
some healthy competition between friends to see who is the safest driver.

## Usage
To use the app either download/clone the repository and open up the client_frontEnd folder in Android Studio and run on an emulator or physical device (preferred). Or you can follow this [link](https://github.com/dvprrsh/Social-Box-Front-End/releases/tag/v1.0-alpha) for the APK download.

## Requirements
* Mobile Android Device (may not be compatible with all versions of Android)
